package.json is a high-level configuration file with metadata and user-defined settings.

package-lock.json is an automatically generated file that locks down the exact versions of dependencies for reproducibility and deterministic installs.
In summary, while package.json describes the project and its configuration, package-lock.json ensures that the installation of dependencies is reproducible across different environments, making it a critical file for reliable and secure project builds.
